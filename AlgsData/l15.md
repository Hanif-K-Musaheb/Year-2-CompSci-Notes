Designed for big data sets stored on disks or other secondary storage devices
Number of I/O operations is minimised

<br>

B-tree nodes **may have more than two children**
Typically thousands depending on the physical characteristic of the hard disk
Height is O(log n) but usually much less than that of a red-black tree
