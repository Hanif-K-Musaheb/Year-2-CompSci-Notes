Designed for big data sets stored on disks or other secondary storage devices
Number of I/O operations is minimised

<br>

B-tree nodes **may have more than two children**
Typically thousands depending on the physical characteristic of the hard disk
Height is O(log n) but usually much less than that of a red-black tree

### The definition
##### Part 1
 - **x.n** is the number of keys stored in the node
 - **x.key[0..x.n-1]** are the x.n keys stored in nondecreasing order
 - **x.leaf** is TRUE if x is a leaf, FALSE otherwise
 - **x.c[0..x.n]** are pointers to the x.n + 1 children of x
##### Part 2
 - An attribute **T.root** points to the root of B-tree **T**
 - We call a fixed integer **t ≥ 2**  the **minimum degree** (number of children) of a B-tree
##### Part 3
 - Leaves have no children (**x.c is NIL**)
 - The keys separate the ranges of keys stored in each subtree (see example below)
 - All leaves have the same depth (which is the tree height)
 - Every node other than the root must have at least **t - 1** keys
 - Every node may contain at most **2t - 1** keys
 - A node is full when it contains **2t - 1** keys]

### worst case height of a B-tree
If n ≥ 1, then for any n-key B-tree T of height h and minimum degree t ≥ 2
$$
h \leq \log_t\left(\frac{n + 1}{2}\right)
$$

### insetions and deletions
these are on l15 slides and youtube videos linked i cba to re explain them here 

### Variants
2-3 trees are B-trees in which every internal node has either two or three children 
2-3-4 trees can have up to 4 children (see slide 6)

B+trees store all the satellite information in the leaves and stores only keys and child pointers in the internal nodes
To maximise their branching factor

B* trees balance more neighbouring internal nodes to keep them more densely packed
This variant ensures non-root nodes are at least 2/3 full instead of 1/2
