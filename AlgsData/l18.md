### Brute force method
 - Input: A and B square n x n matrices
 - Output: product C= AB n x n matrix
 - Running time is Q(n3)
     - n3 multiplications and n2(n – 1) additions

### Divide and Conquer method

Partition A and B into four n/2 x n/2 matrices

Assume n is a power of 2

Product C=AB can be computed as

The running time is O($n^3$) same as MATRIX-MULT!

### Strassen’s algorithm
Normally, multiplying two 𝑛

𝑛
n×n matrices takes 
𝑂
(

O(n

 ) time. Strassen found a way to reduce that to 
𝑂
(

)
≈

 ) using divide and conquer with fewer multiplications.
 - can have problems dealing with floating point math as it has to store values which can cause small in-aquracies that will build with recursive calls.
