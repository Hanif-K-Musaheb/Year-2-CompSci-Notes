# [Hash Tables](https://github.com/Khair9/Year-2-CompSci-Notes/blob/main/AlgsData/AlgsData.md)
###### Other names: **associative array, symbol table, dictionary**
A map models a searchable collection of key/value pairs

Multiple entries with the same key are not allowed (keys must be unique)

### the basic operations
 - **INSERT(M,k,v)**: add a pair (k,v) to map M
 - **DELETE(M,k)**: remove key k and its value from map M
 - **SEARCH(M,k)**: find a pair with key k in map M

### Auxiliary map operation
 - **MAP-EMPTY(M)**: test whether no key/value pairs are stored in map M
## Implimentations
### list based implementation
 - We can implement a map M using an unsorted doubly-linked list 
   - Values are stored as satellite data (attribute if small, pointer for larger structures)
 - **INSERT** takes **O(1)** time (**O(n)** if we first check for duplicates)
 - **SEARCH** and **DELETE** take **O(n)** time since in the worst case (the item is not found) we traverse the entire list to look for an item with the given key

### Tree-based implementation
 - **Self-balancing trees** guarantee a worst-case time complexity of **O(log n)** for all the main operation of the Map ADT
 - **Inorder** traversal allows us to get a **sorted** sequence of all the pairs stored in the map

 ### Direct-address tables
 - Assumptions
   - Each element of the map has an integer key drawn from the universe U = {0,1,…, m – 1}, where m is not too large
   - No two elements have the same key
 - We use an array or direct-address table T[0,..,m - 1] to represent the map
   -  Each position (also called slot or bucket) in T corresponds to a key in the universe U
 - Operations are trivial to implement
   - Each operation takes O(1) time
  
 - Operations are trivial to implement
 - Each operation takes O(1) time

 - Space requirement is the size of the universe of keys U = {0,1,…, m – 1}
 - Impractical unless m is small

 - In some applications key/value pairs are stored directly in T 
 - To further save space, the key is not stored as knowing the index is enough to determine the key of an object

 - A hash collision is when 2 keys are mapped to the same position

### Interpreting keys as natural numbers
Most hash functions assume the universe of keys U = ℕ (the set of natural numbers)

#### Memory address
 - Convert the memory address of the key into an integer
   - Default hash code of all Java objects (in Java < 8)
 - Good in general, except for numeric and string keys
 - Addresses tend to exhibit regularity, resulting in high clustering with some hash table implementations
#### Integer Cast
 - Reinterpret the bits of the key as an integer
 - Suitable for keys of length less than or equal to the number of bits of the integer type 
 - In Java, the int data type is 32-bit
   - This method can be used cast keys of type byte (8-bit), short (16-bit), char (16-bit), and float (32-bit)
   - Keys of type long (64-bit) and double (64-bit) cannot use this method
     
#### Component sum
 - We partition the bits of the key into components of fixed length (16 or 32 bits) and we sum the components
   - Overflows are ignored
 - Suitable for numeric keys of fixed length greater than or equal to the number of bits of the integer type
   - long and double in Java

#### Polynomial accumulation
 - The bits of the key are partitioned into a sequence of components of fixed length a0a1…an-1 
   - Typical lengths are 8, 16 or 32 bits
 - Evaluate the polynomial p(z) = a0 + a1z  + a2z2 + … + an-1zn-1 at a fixed value z
   - If the key is long, it may cause an overflow

 - Especially suitable for strings
   - Experiments have shown that values like 33, 37, 39, and 41 are particularly good choices for z when working with character strings that are English words 
   - In a list of over 50,000 English words, taking z to be 33, 37, 39, or 41 produced less than 7 collisions in each case
