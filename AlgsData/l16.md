###### Other names: **associative array, symbol table, dictionary**
A map models a searchable collection of key/value pairs

Multiple entries with the same key are not allowed (keys must be unique)

### the basic operations
 - **INSERT(M,k,v)**: add a pair (k,v) to map M
 - **DELETE(M,k)**: remove key k and its value from map M
 - **SEARCH(M,k)**: find a pair with key k in map M

### Auxiliary map operation
 - **MAP-EMPTY(M)**: test whether no key/value pairs are stored in map M
## Implimentations
### list based implementation
 - We can implement a map M using an unsorted doubly-linked list 
   - Values are stored as satellite data (attribute if small, pointer for larger structures)
 - **INSERT** takes **O(1)** time (**O(n)** if we first check for duplicates)
 - **SEARCH** and **DELETE** take **O(n)** time since in the worst case (the item is not found) we traverse the entire list to look for an item with the given key

### Tree-based implementation
 - **Self-balancing trees** guarantee a worst-case time complexity of **O(log n)** for all the main operation of the Map ADT
 - **Inorder** traversal allows us to get a **sorted** sequence of all the pairs stored in the map

 ### Direct-address tables
 - Assumptions
   - Each element of the map has an integer key drawn from the universe U = {0,1,…, m – 1}, where m is not too large
   - No two elements have the same key
 - We use an array or direct-address table T[0,..,m - 1] to represent the map
   -  Each position (also called slot or bucket) in T corresponds to a key in the universe U
 - Operations are trivial to implement
   - Each operation takes O(1) time
