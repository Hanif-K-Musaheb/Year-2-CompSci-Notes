### Binary trees
A binary tree is a linked data structure in which each node x has an attribute key and three pointer attributes
 - x.p points to its parent
 - x.left points to its left child
 - x.right points to its right child

If a child or the parent is missing, the appropriate attribute is set to NIL
 - The root of the three is the only node whose parent is NIL
 - Node x is a leaf when x.left = x.right = NIL

### Balanced trees

A binary tree is balanced if the height difference (also called the balance factor) between the left and right subtrees of every node is no more than one.

###### In simple terms:

For every node in the tree:
```| height(left subtree) - height(right subtree) | ≤ 1```

### Rooted trees with unbounded branching
Trees with an unbounded number of children can easily be represented with additional attributes
 - x.left-child points to the leftmost child of x
 - x.right-sibling points to the sibling of x immediately to its right

 - If x has no children x.left-child = NIL
 - If x is the rightmost child x.right-sibling = NIL

###### Limitations
Accessing a child is O(k) as we need to scan all the list of children to access the rightmost child
k is the maximum branch degree

### Other tree representations
- Some algorithms only need to traverse the tree bottom up
- Only the parent pointers are present; no pointers to children 

Computing the size of a tree with n nodes is O(n)
Include a size attribute in each node: x.size = 1 + x.left.size +x.right.size

###### Strategies to handle duplicate keys
- Keep a list of nodes with equal keys at x
- More examples in next labs


### Binary Search Tree (BST)
A binary search tree (BST) is a binary tree satisfying the binary-search-tree property
Let x be a node. If y is a node in the left subtree of x, then y.key ≤ x.key. If y is a node in the right subtree of x, then y.key ≥ x.key

Inorder traversal of a BST is an ordered sequence
3,4,5,6,7,8,9,12

Operations to search for a key stored in a BST
```
SEARCH
MINIMUM
MAXIMUM
SUCCESSOR
PREDECESSOR
```
The running time of each of these operations is O(h) on any BST of height h
At each step we can disregard one subtree depending on the key values
More efficient than querying ordinary binary trees

### SUCCESSOR
Given a node, find its successor in the sorted order determined by an inorder traversal

If all keys are distinct, the successor of a node x is the node with the smallest key greater than x.key

No comparison of keys performed
Exploit the structure of the BST

Return NIL if x is the maximum

### PREDESSOR
Given a node, find its predecessor in the sorted order determined by an inorder traversal
