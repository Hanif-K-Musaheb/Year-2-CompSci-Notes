## Counting Sort
Counting Sort is a non-comparison-based sorting algorithm used for sorting a collection of non-negative integers. It works by counting the number of occurrences of each unique element in the input, then calculating the positions of each element in the sorted output.
### How It Works:

Given an input array arr[] of size n with elements ranging from 0 to k:

 1. Count: Create a count array count[] of size k+1 and count the frequency of each element in arr[].

 1. Accumulate: Modify count[] such that each element at index i contains the number of elements â‰¤ i.

 1. Build Output: Use count[] to place elements into the correct sorted position in an output array.

 1. Copy Back: Copy the sorted output back into the original array, if needed.

### Note:
 - Not efficient when k is much larger than n (e.g., sorting [0, 1, 1000000]).
 - it is **stable**

## Radix Sort
Radix Sort is a non-comparative sorting algorithm that sorts numbers digit by digit, starting from either the least significant digit (LSD) or the most significant digit (MSD). It uses a stable sub-sorting algorithm (typically Counting Sort) to sort the digits at each position.


### ðŸ§  How Radix Sort Works (LSD Variant)
Letâ€™s sort an array of numbers based on individual digits:

1. Example Input: ```[170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, 2, 66]```

2. Sort by units digit â†’ ```[170, 90, 802, 2, 24, 45, 75, 66]```

1. Sort by tens digit â†’ ```[802, 2, 24, 45, 66, 170, 75, 90]```

1. Sort by hundreds digit â†’ ```[2, 24, 45, 66, 75, 90, 170, 802]```

Done! âœ…
### notes
 - Only works well with integers or strings where you can break things into digits/characters.
 - Needs extra space.
 - Must be adapted for negative numbers or floating-point numbers.
 - Yes, Radix Sort is stable as long as the sub-sorting algorithm used (like Counting Sort) is stable.
