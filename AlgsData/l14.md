### rotations
Rotations are needed because the core rules of a red black tree may not be satified when an item is removed or inserted. To keep the integretity of the tree we must preform rotations with these functions to keep the order of said tree.

#### what a rotation is

1. Alters the structure of a tree by rearranging subtrees
2. goal is to decrease the height of the tree
   - (red - black trees: max height of O(log n))
   - larger subtrees up, smaller subtrees down
3.does not effect the order of elements

- 5s right child (10) becomes its parent
- 10s left child (8) becomes 5s right child

- essentially the symetric opposite

  #### time complexity of rotation
  O(1) because were are just changing a few pointers in a tree

### insertions
z is the item we are inserting
#### strategy
 1. insert Z and color it red
 1. recolor and rotate nodes to fix violation

### scenarios
1. z=root
2. z.uncle = red
3. z.uncle = black(triangle)
4. z.uncle = black(line)

##### case 1 
soloution --> color z black

##### case 2

#### Summary
1. Z= root -> color black
2. Z.uncle = red -> recolor
3. Zuncle = black (triangle) -> rotate Z. parent
4. Z.uncle - black (line) -> rotate z.grandparent & recolor

## AVL trees


| Feature               | **AVL Tree**                       | **Red-Black Tree**                   |
|----------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Balancing strategy   | Height-based                       | Color and black-height rules         |
| Balance strictness   | Stricter (balance factor –1, 0, 1) | More relaxed                         |
| Lookup time          | Faster on average                  | Slightly slower                      |
| Insert/Delete cost   | More rotations                     | Fewer rotations                      |
| Best for             | Lookup-heavy operations            | Insertion/deletion-heavy operations  |
| Worst-case height    | ~1.44 log(n)                       | ≤ 2 log(n + 1)                        |
