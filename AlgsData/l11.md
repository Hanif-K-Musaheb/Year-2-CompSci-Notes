# [Abstract Data types](https://github.com/Khair9/Year-2-CompSci-Notes/blob/main/AlgsData/AlgsData.md)
Abstract Datatypes(ADTs) --> Used to abstract the structure of data from the data itself
Examples:
```
Set, Multiset (bag)
List
Stack
Queue, Priority queue, Double ended queue
```
### ADTs vs Data structures
 - An ADT is a class of objects whose logical behaviour is defined by a set of values and a set of operation (User’s point of view)

 - Data structures are concrete representations of data and implementations of the procedures for its manipulation (Implementer’s point of view)

 - Data structures serve as the basis for ADTs. The ADT defines the logical form of the data type. The data structure implements the physical form of the data type
