# [Abstract Data types](https://github.com/Khair9/Year-2-CompSci-Notes/blob/main/AlgsData/AlgsData.md)
Abstract Datatypes(ADTs) --> Used to abstract the structure of data from the data itself
Examples:
```
Set, Multiset (bag)
List
Stack
Queue, Priority queue, Double ended queue
```
### ADTs vs Data structures
 - An ADT is a class of objects whose logical behaviour is defined by a set of values and a set of operation (User’s point of view)

 - Data structures are concrete representations of data and implementations of the procedures for its manipulation (Implementer’s point of view)

 - Data structures serve as the basis for ADTs. The ADT defines the logical form of the data type. The data structure implements the physical form of the data type

### Stack
Insertions and deletions follow the LIFO (last-in-first-out) policy

#### Main stack operations
 - PUSH(S,x): insert element x in stack S
 - POP(S): remove and return the most recently inserted element from stack S

#### Auxiliary stack operations
 - PEEK(S): return the most recently inserted element from stack S (sometimes called TOP(S))
 - STACK-SIZE(S): return the number of elements stored in stack S
 - STACK-EMPTY(S): test whether no elements are stored in stack S

### Queue
Insertions and deletions follow the FIFO (first-in-first-out) policy

#### Main queue operations
 - ENQUEUE(Q,x): insert element x at the end (rear, tail) of queue Q
 - DEQUEUE(Q): remove and return the element at the front (head) of queue Q

#### Auxiliary queue operations
 - FRONT(Q): return the element at the from queue Q without removing it
 - QUEUE-SIZE(Q): return the number of elements stored in queue Q
 - QUEUE-EMPTY(S): test whether no elements are stored in queue Q

### Double ended queue

Generalisation of the queue ADTs that supports insertion and deletion from both ends
Also called Dequeue

#### Operations
 - PUSH-BACK(Q,x): insert element x at the end of queue Q (same as ENQUEUE)
 - PUSH-FRONT(Q,x): insert element x at the front of queue Q (also called UNSHIFT) 
 - POP-BACK(Q): remove and return the element at the end of queue Q
 - POP-FRONT(Q): remove and return the element at the front of queue Q (also called SHIFT) (same as DEQUEUE)
