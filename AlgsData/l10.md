# [Linked Lists](https://github.com/Khair9/Year-2-CompSci-Notes/blob/main/AlgsData/AlgsData.md)
### Disadvantages of arrays:
 - Inserting/deleting a new element requires much of array to be rewritten
 - Array size is fixed, must be estimated before use
 - If only few items held, much of array (hence memory) is wasted

### Using dynamic data structures (linked data structures)
 - We donâ€™t need to know how many items to expect
 - We can increase/decrease memory when items added/deleted

### quick explanation of linked lists
Each node (or element) of a (singly) linked list L has an attribute key and a pointer attribute next
 - Given a node x in the list, x.next points to its successor in the linked list
 - If x.next = NIL, x has no successor and is therefore the last element, or tail, of the list

### Tail Pointer
 - The definition of linked list is extended to include an attribute L.tail pointing to the last element of list L

 - If L.head = L.tail = NIL, the list is empty

### Doubly Linked Lists
Extension of singly linked list in which each node has a pointer attribute prev
<Br>
 - Pro: some operations are simplified and become more efficient
 - Con: memory overhead

### Circular doubly linked list with a sentinel
 - Boundary conditions complicate the specification of the operations on doubly linked lists 
 - We can introduce sentinels to simplify the code

 - A **sentinel** is a **dummy node** **L.nil** between the head and tail
 - **L.nil.next** points to the head
 - **L.nil.prev** points to the tail
 - The next attribute of the tail and the prev attribute of the head point to **L.nil**
 - Attribute **L.head** is no longer needed (use **L.nil.next** instead)
