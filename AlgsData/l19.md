Dynamic Programming (DP) is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems — and storing the results of those subproblems so you don’t solve the same thing more than once.

It’s like using memory (also called memoization) to avoid redundant work. DP is especially useful in optimization problems and in cases where naive recursion leads to exponential time complexity.

###### Key Idea: "If a problem can be divided into overlapping subproblems with optimal substructure, solve each subproblem once and store its result."


1. Structure
   - Characterise the structure of an optimal solution
1. Principle of optimality
    - Recursively define the value of an optimal solution
1. Bottom-up computation
    - Compute the value of an optimal solution using a table
1. Construction of an optimal solution
    - Use computed information to construct an optimal
  
### The knapsack problem
Given weights and values of n items, we need to put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack
Classical problem in combinatorial optimisation

##### There are two versions of this problem:

 - 0-1 knapsack problem
     - Items are indivisible; you either take an item or not

 - Fractional knapsack problem
     - Items are divisible: you can take any fraction of an item
##### Soloutions
 - Brute force algorithm
   - Go through all combinations and find the one with maximum value and with total weight less or equal to W
   - Running time is O($2^n$)
 - Divide and Conquer
   - the same as other divide and conquer algorithms, however alone divide and conquer doesn't reduce the time complexity from  O($2^n$)
   - to improve the time complexity pruning of the decision tree must be made which give a heuristic best soloution    


### Greedy Algorithms
A greedy algorithm is a problem-solving approach where you make the locally optimal choice at each step, hoping that these local choices will lead to a globally optimal solution.
