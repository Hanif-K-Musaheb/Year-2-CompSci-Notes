# [Collision Resolution](https://github.com/Khair9/Year-2-CompSci-Notes/blob/main/AlgsData/AlgsData.md)
- When two keys are mapped to the same position in array T, we have a hash collision
- Ideally hash function is easy to compute and no collisions occur

### Collision Resolution by Chaining
All elements that hash to the same slot are stored in a linked list (called chain)
Doubly linked list to support fast deletion
Usually, no check is performed to prevent the insertion of elements with duplicate keys
Some implementations store the first element of each list directly in T
###### Analysis
- The worst case running time for insertion is O(1)
   - Searching is required if we check for duplicates before insertions

 - Deletion is O(1) if the list in doubly linked and the input of the procedure is x
     - Searching is required if the input is key k

 - Searching takes O(n) in the worst case
     - All n keys hash to the same slot creating a list of length n

 - The average case running time for searching depends on how well h distributes the keys over the m slots

### Simple Uniform Hashing Assumption
 - We assume that hash function h evenly distributes items into the m slots
 - Each item has an equal probability of being placed into a slot, regardless of the other elements already in the table

 - Simplifies the mathematical analysis of hash tables

 - We also assume that it takes O(1) time to compute h(k)

 - Load factor for T with m slots is ⍺ = n/m
 - This is the average number of elements stored in a chain
 - Previous example 128/43 ≈ 2.97


### Collision resolution by open addressing

 - If a collision occurs, alternative cells are tried (or probed) until an empty cell is found
 - Does not use linked lists to resolve hash collisions 
 - Pointers are avoided (more space available for slots)

 - To determine which slots to probe, the hash function is extended to include the probe number (starting from 0) as a second input: h: U x {0,1,…,m-1} → {0,1,…,m-1}
With open addressing, we require that every hash-table position is eventually considered as a slot for a new key as the table fills up

 - Method preferred when **memory limited** (small handheld device or sensor network)

When two keys hash to the same index (a collision), we need to find the next available spot in the hash table. Both linear and quadratic probing do this by searching for an empty slot — but they differ in how they calculate the next index.

#### linear probing 

##### Formula:
$$ New index=(ℎ(𝑘)+𝑖)mod 𝑚 $$
$$ New index=(h(k)+i)mod m $$
h(k) = original hash function

i = probe attempt (0, 1, 2, ...)
m = size  of  the  table 

How it works:
Checks the next cell: h(k) + 1, then h(k) + 2, and so on.

Simple, fast, but can lead to primary clustering (groups of filled slots forming and making collisions more likely).

##### Quadratic Probing

Formula:
New index=(ℎ(𝑘)+𝑐1𝑖+𝑐2𝑖^2)mod 𝑚

c₁ and c₂ are constants (often c₁ = 0, c₂ = 1)

Reduces primary clustering, but can still suffer from secondary clustering (keys that hash to the same index follow the same probe sequence).


#### 🧾 TL;DR: Comparison Table

| Feature             | Linear Probing              | Quadratic Probing             |
|---------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Formula**         | `(h(k) + i) % m`            | `(h(k) + i²) % m` (or general)|
| **Clustering**      | Primary Clustering          | Secondary Clustering          |
| **Probe Pattern**   | Sequential                  | Spread out (non-linear)       |
| **Simplicity**      | Easier                      | Slightly more complex         |
| **Memory Access**   | Better (cache-friendly)     | Worse (less predictable)      |


##### Double Hashing
 - The value h2(k) must be relatively prime to the hash-table size m for the entire hash table to be searched
 - Let m be a power of 2 and design h2 to always produce an odd number
 - Let m be prime and design h2 to always return a positive integer less than m
