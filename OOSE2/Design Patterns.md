# Design Patterns

## Strategy Design (weeks 1/5):
**What:** The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate them, and make them interchangeable at runtime.

**When to use:**
- When you have multiple algorithms for a specific task and want to switch between them dynamically.
- To remove complex conditional statements (if-else or switch-case).
- To follow the Open/Closed Principle (new strategies can be added without modifying existing code).
