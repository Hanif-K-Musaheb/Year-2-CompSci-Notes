### Bugs
_A common term used to describe a flaw, mistake, or failure in a computer system that produces an incorrect or unexpected result or causes it to behave in unintended ways._

Everything we don’t like is a bug! 

#### Reasons for bugs
1. The software doesn't do something that the product specification says it should do.
1. The software does something that the product specification says it shouldn't do.
1. The software does something that the product specification doesn't mention.
1. The software doesn't do something that the product specification doesn't mention but should.
1. The software is difficult to understand, hard to use, slow, or—in the software tester's eyes—will be viewed by the end user as just plain not right.

#### Causes of bugs

##### Specification
- Unwritten or incomplete
- Ambiguous 
- Constantly changing
- Not communicated to the development team
##### Design 
- Inappropriate modelling
- Lack of modelling tools
- Time to market pressure
##### Code
Software complexity
Poor documentation 
Limited time
Programmer skills
##### Reliability
However, failures seem random, hence Bayesian (probabilistic) theories over time are applied
 - R(t) - the probability of software still functioning at a given point in time (t) 
 - Availability/up-time - what percentage of the time will a service be available (particularly useful in online services)
 - Mean time between failures (MTBF) - how long, on average, will you go before the system fails again
##### Debugging

The debugger lets you decide if you want to:
 - Resume operation – run until the next breakpoint or until the program terminates
 - Step over – move past a line of code
 - Step in – execute the next line of code
 - Step out – leave method
 - Restart
 - Terminate the program
