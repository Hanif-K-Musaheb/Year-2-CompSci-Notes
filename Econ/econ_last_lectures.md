 - **Inflation**: An increase in the average level of prices
 - Inflation is measured by changes in a price index.
 - The inflation rate is the percentage change in a price index from one year to the next.

### price indexees
1. **Consumer price index (CPI):** Measures the average price for a basket of goods and services bought by a typical consumer; covers thousands of goods and services and is weighted so major items count more.
1. **GDP deflator:** The ratio of nominal to real GDP multiplied by 100; covers finished goods and services. 
1. **Producer price indexes (PPI):** Measure the average price received by producers; includes intermediate and finished goods and services.

### Quantity Theory of Money
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a3c6190-c80e-4fdb-bc74-767d861257e9)
 - M = Money Supply
 - P = Price level
 - v = Velocity of money
 - YR = Real GDP
 - Since Mv is the total amount spent on finished goods and services, and PYR is the the price level times real GDP, both sides of this equation are also equal to nominal GDP.
 - **Velocity of money** The average number of times a dollar is spent on finished goods and services in a year. In short, it refers to how fast money passes from one holder to the next.

 - **Deflation**: A decrease in the average level of prices (a negative inflation rate).
 - **Disinflation**: A reduction in the inflation rate.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6797fb35-63ca-42fa-812f-51834acf5073)
 - **Money illusion**: When people mistake changes in nominal prices for changes in real prices.
 - **Real rate of return**: The nominal rate of return minus the inflation rate.
 - **Nominal rate of return**: The rate of return that does not account for inflation.

 - **Fisher effect:** The tendency of nominal interest rates to rise with expected inflation rates.
 - The Fisher effect says that **the nominal interest rate is equal to the expected inflation rate plus the equilibrium real interest rate.**

So, basically saying if the actual intrest rates are higher than expected then it benifits borrower, if it is the other way round it benefit lenders
