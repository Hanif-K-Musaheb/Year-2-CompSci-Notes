## Exam Info
 - Exam structure: solve 1 out of 2 provided problems, each problem is weighted at 100%.
 - Each problem has two parts, and each part is valued at 50%.
### How to approach the exam
 - Revise using our workshops and tutorial problem sets.
 - For graphing: label everything clearly, know what goes on each axis, know what each function is.
 - Explain everything that you are doing in detail â€“ why did the curve shift in this particular way? Why is the solution to the problem using this particular formula? Etc. 
And overall, do not overthink your solutions. Economics is quite a logical and common-sense discipline.
