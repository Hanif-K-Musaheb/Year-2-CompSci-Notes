# [Lecture 14 (Chapter 26) GDP and the Measurement of Progress](https://github.com/Hanif-K-Musaheb/Year-2-CompSci-Notes/blob/main/Econ/econ.md)

 - **Gross domestic product (GDP):** The market value of all finished goods and services produced within a country in a year.

### what counts towards GDP
 - Intermediate goods are sold to firms and then bundled or processed with other goods or services for sale at a later stage.
 - Finished goods are sold to final users and then consumed or held in personal inventories.
 - To avoid double counting, only finished goods are included in GDP.
 - However, machinery and equipment used to produce other goods are included in GDP.

 - **Gross national product (GNP)** The market value of all finished goods and services produced by a country’s permanent residents, wherever they are located, within a year.

### ways of calculating gdp
Three common ways:
 - **National spending approach:** Add up the components of spending.Y = C + I + G + (Exports – Imports)
 - **Factor income approach:** Add up the income generated by producing goods and services.Y = Employee Compensation + Rent + Interest + Profit
 - **Value added per firm approach:** value of sales – costs of intermediate goods. This number is then summed up for all the firms within the economy.

 - **Nominal variables:** Variables, such as nominal GDP, that have not been adjusted for changes in price.

 - **Real variables:** Variables such as real GDP that have been adjusted for changes in prices by using the same set of prices in all time periods.

``` GDP deflator = (Nominal GDP)/(Real GDP) * 100 ```

 - **Recession:** A significant, widespread decline in real GDP and employment.
 - **Business fluctuations** (or business cycles): Short-run movements in real GDP around its long-term trend.

GDP does not include:
 - Goods in the underground economy
 - The value of goods that are difficult to price
 - The value of bads
 - The health of nations
 - The distribution of income

# Lecture 15 (Chapter 27) The Wealth of Nations and Economic Growth
Economic growth is measured as:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe749126-5219-4240-a95a-6b3b43bc8dcb)

Where:
- ```gt = growth rate of real GDP per capita```
- ```yt = real GDP per capita in time period t```

##### Rule of 70
_The rule of 70 approximates the length of time necessary for a growing variable to double_

_Example: If real GDP per capita is growing at an annual growth rate of 3.5%, it will double in:_

``` 70/3.5 = 20 ```

##### value of GDP for any given year, 𝑦𝑡
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a97989c-a4c9-4055-9d03-b904cf6afcf0)
In the formula:
- 𝑦0 is the value of GDP in the beginning year
- 𝑦𝑡 is the value of GDP for the specific year in question
- 𝑔𝑦 is the growth rate
- t is the number of years after 𝑦0.


 - **Institutions:** The “rules of the game” that structure economic incentives.
 - Institutions of economic growth include:
    - Property rights
    - Honest government
    - Political stability
    - A dependable legal system
    - Competitive and open markets
